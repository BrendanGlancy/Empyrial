## Documentation

Displaying the graph of the close price of a stock in a given time

```sh
#graph_close(stock, start_date, end_date)
#get the graph of a stock
graph_close(["FB"], "2020-01-01", "2021-01-01")
```

```sh
#get the graph of multiple stocks
graph_close(["FB", "AAPL", "TSLA"], "2020-01-01", "2021-01-01")
```

It's the same principle for displaying the volume's graph of a stock, the open's graph, and the adjourned close's graph

```sh
graph_volume(["FB", "AAPL", "TSLA"], "2020-01-01", "2021-01-01")
graph_open(["FB", "AAPL", "TSLA"], "2020-01-01", "2021-01-01")
graph_adj_close(["FB", "AAPL", "TSLA"], "2020-01-01", "2021-01-01")
```

Displaying the graph of the revenus of stock/stocks during a given time

```sh
returns_graph(["FB"], "2020-01-01", "2021-01-01")
#or for multiple stocks
returns_graph(["FB", "AAPL", "TSLA"], "2020-01-01", "2021-01-01")
```

Displaying the dataframe of close price

```sh
close(["FB"], "2020-01-01", "2021-01-01")
```
Displaying the dataframe of volume

```sh
volume(["FB"], "2020-01-01", "2021-01-01")
```
Displaying the dataframe of open price
```sh
open(["FB"], "2020-01-01", "2021-01-01")
```
Displaying the dataframe of ajourned close
```sh
adj_close(["FB"], "2020-01-01", "2021-01-01")
```
